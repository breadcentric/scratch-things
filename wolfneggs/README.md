# Wolf'n'eggs
My cousins used to have this awesome game in the early 90s. 
We would not get all of the western games that easily at
the time but there was a Soviet equivalent: [the IM Series](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seria_IM)
We used to have this cartoon called A Wolf and a Hare.
You get the idea: the Wolf wants to catch the Hare but never succeeds.

The wolf however has made a successful lead act in this video
game that you can see in the Wikipedia article linked above.

This is a set of resources to help you recreate this game.
